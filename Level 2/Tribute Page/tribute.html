<h2>A brief summary of Pichai's journey</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>
    Pichai was born in Madurai(June 10, 1972), Tamil Nadu, India. His mother, Lakshmi, was a stenographer, and his father, Regunatha
    Pichai, was an electrical engineer at GEC, the British conglomerate. His father also had a manufacturing plant that
    produced electrical components.
</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p> 
    Pichai completed schooling in Jawahar Vidyalaya Senior Secondary School in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and completed the
    Class XII from Vana Vani school at IIT Madras. He earned his degree from IIT Kharagpur in metallurgical engineering 
    and is a distinguished alumnus from that institution. He holds an M.S. from Stanford University in materials science 
    and engineering, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was named a Siebel 
    Scholar and a Palmer Scholar, respectively.
</p>
<h3>Career</h3>
<p>
    Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey 
    & Company. Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite
    of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible
    for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. On
    November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of ChromeOS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 
    2011, and released to the public in 2012. On May 20, 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec 
    VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.
</p>
<p>
    On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw. Android was formerly managed by 
    Andy Rubin. He was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30, 2013. Pichai was selected to become the next 
    CEO of Google on August 10, 2015 after previously being appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015,

    Google company family.

    Nadella. In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote a ten-page manifesto criticizing 
    the company's diversity policies. In December 2017, Pichai was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China, 
    where he stated that "a lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized 
    businesses in China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China." In 
    December 2019, Pichai became the CEO of Alphabet Inc. In December 2020, Pichai delivered a speech virtually at the
